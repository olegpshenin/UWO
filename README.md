# UWO
This project is a set of small tools which simplifies your workflow.

1. **Raycast Targets Maanger**: a tool that allows you to easily manage raycast target properties in any size UI systems.
>Saved huge amount of time, especialy for unchecking raycast target inside TextMeshProUGUI component (it is inside folded menu).
<br>

2. **Text Editor**: a tool that allows you to very quickly edit any file with text content without leaving unity editor.
>Usefull if you need to update readme or local text config, but no more.
<br>

3. **Copy, Cut and Paste**: a tool that allows you to copy, cut and paste inside project folder.
>Have no idea why unity doesn't have it in-built, you can't use explorer beacuse of meta files, so you are forced to use drag-and-drop which is super-annoying especialy in deep hierarchy or when you do project structure optimizing/cleaning.

### =====In Progress=====
<br>

4. **Generic scriptable data sets** (waiting for cleaning)
>Unified way to keep data to not overwrite each time initing or getting values
<br>

5. **Switching scenes by hotkey** (waiting for in-editor menu)
>Save the time a lot if you are using mulriple scenes
<br>

6. **Dublication objects without indexing by hot key** (waiting for uploading)
>Useful time to time, if you don't want to see (1) and so
<br>

7. **Custom layout system with reverse refresh logic** (from bottom to top)
>Unity's UI layout with depth more than 2 doesn't work correctly at all (for example if you are using "price" object with multiple types of currencies with images and dynamic texts for each)
